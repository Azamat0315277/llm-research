My apartment is newly renovated, clean, cosy, comfortable, large enough for 8 people and is situated literally at the heart of Istanbul. Apartment has one of the unique examples of turn-of-the-century Levantine architecture in Turkey: slim, four-storey bow-fronted homes that huddle along winding, narrow streets.  Located in a street as it was used to be; the ground floors often served as stores or workshops.  More likes to come to your posts in Instagram ! As a traveller my wish is to make you feel at home; drink your morning coffee while listening to the sound of Istanbul then take your map, jump into the street with friendly neighborhood,  and enjoy the city without running, walking, exploring, watching, reading and hearing. I know how it is important to be able to feel the city you are visiting. So if you are looking for a place where</td>\n",
